Machine Learning

A structured collection of Machine Learning concepts, implementations, and experiments built using Python.
This repository documents my learning journey in Machine Learning, covering fundamental algorithms, data handling, and practical model implementation using Jupyter Notebooks.

📌 Overview

This repository includes:

Data preprocessing techniques

Implementation of core ML algorithms

Model training and evaluation

Visualization of results

Hands-on experimentation using NumPy and other ML libraries

The goal is to build strong foundational understanding while applying concepts practically.
